Hi there, my name is Liyan Huang. I'm currently in my second year pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at University of Southern California, where I'm happy to get advice and work with [Professor Weihang Wang](https://weihang-wang.github.io). Prior to enrolling at USC, I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University.
I'm also honored to have the chance to work at ByteDance as a software engineer intern for half a year.

My research interests include _Software Engineering_ and _Software Security_, with a particular emphasis on _WebAssembly_ and its associated research topics. My current work focuses on developing testing and analysis techniques to enhance WebAssemblyâ€™s reliability. I am also open to exploring other research areas, such as NLP and Computer Systems. I always hope to build sound software systems and make meaningful contributions to the community.
